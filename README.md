# Admissibility Before Optimization  
### Architectural Framework for Irreversible Decisions in Long-Horizon Adaptive Systems

This repository contains an architectural and conceptual body of work describing a missing layer in modern adaptive systems: **admissibility as a pre-optimization primitive**.

The work addresses a recurring failure mode in long-horizon systems where irreversible operations are evaluated too early, leading to structural degradation despite locally correct optimization.

## Status

- A **U.S. provisional patent application** covering the architectural mechanisms described here has been filed.
- This repository and associated publications serve as **prior art and architectural disclosure**, not as an implementation.
- No algorithms, thresholds, estimators, or executable methods are disclosed.

---

## What this work is

- An **architectural framing**, not an algorithm
- A conceptual separation between:
  - *authorization* (what may be considered)
  - *optimization* (how choices are ranked)
- A treatment of irreversibility as a **structural property**, not a cost or risk score

---

## What this work is not

- Not an optimizer
- Not a learning algorithm
- Not a safety constraint technique
- Not a reward-shaping or penalty method
- Not a runnable system

This work does **not** disclose:
- mathematical formulations of admissibility
- methods for computing irreversibility
- implementations of internal time
- thresholds, metrics, or estimators

The absence of these details is intentional.
